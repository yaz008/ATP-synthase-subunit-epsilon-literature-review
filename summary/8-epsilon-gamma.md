# Role of the epsilon sybunit as an ATP sensor

## Abstract

- **Nothing interesting except possibly some phrases for the section introduction**

## Introduction

- ATP synthases (F1Fo-ATPases) are highly conserved enzyme complexes located in inner bacterial and mitochondrial membranes, and chloroplast thylakoid membranes (for introduction)
- Pump activity reference (1)
- three α-subunits and three β-subunits are arranged alternately around a coiled pair of helices formed by the N- and C-termini of the γ-subunit

## Gamma-Epsilon structure

- The plane of the beta-sandwich of ε is aligned parallel to the coiled coil, with the beta-strands approximately orthogonal to the direction of the helices
- The portion of the γ-subunit lying on the opposite side of the coiled coil from the epsilon-subunit beta-sandwich is a helix-sheet-helix domain, featuring a five-stranded beta-sheet wedged between two alpha-helices formed by residues 91–108 (γ-α3) and 150–161 (γ-α5)
- the helices form a tight hairpin, and both interact with the beta-sandwich - in contrast, the structure of gamma′–epsilon shows the helices to be separated from one another and from the beta-sandwich, and wrapped around the outside of the gamma-subunit
- these helices possess considerable freedom of movement within F1F0
- C-terminal helix epsilon-α2 spans and interacts with the DELSEED (residues 380–386) regions of two beta-subunits following ATP hydrolysis in the catalytic sites, but that these interactions are disrupted upon subsequent binding of ATP
- Page 1053 left central part has a perfect description of the interactions involving subunit epsilon
- The helix epsilon-α1 has much less contact with the alpha3-beta3 hexamer, and its removal would be expected to have a greater effect on epsilon binding to F1 than inhibition of enzyme activity
- The retention of enzyme activity by ε mutants lacking helix epsilon-α2 suggests that this domain does not greatly influence the conformations of the catalytic sites during rotation
- The sandwich is, therefore, unlikely to play any direct role in influencing the conformations of the beta-subunits during rotation, but may be important in the binding of the gamma-epsilon complex to the c-subunit ring
