# Isolated subunit epsilon

## Abstract

- No subunits other that alpha and beta can bind ATP - wrong! Epsilon can indeed
- The subunit epsilon lacking the C-terminal helical hairpin was unable to bind ATP

## Introduction

- First paragraph has a short and concise introduction
- The up-state of subunit epsilon exerts the inhibitory effect on ATP hydrolysis activity but, interestingly, **not** on ATP synthesis activity of F0F1
- The ATP binding to the catalytic site(-s) on the subunit(-s) triggers the conformational transitions of the subunit epsilon
- The subunit epsilon in F0F1 acts not only as a regulator of F0F1 but also as a sensor for cellular ATP level

## Experiment (meterials & methods is completely useless)

- **Nothing interesting yet**

## Results

- Mg2+ was not required for ATP to bind to TF1-epsilon(nd)
- The new band disappeared by addition of ATP, ensuring that BzATP competes for the same site with ATP (photoaffinity study)
- Thus TF1-epsilon(nd) only binds ATP but not other nucleotides under the examined conditions
- the C-terminally truncated TF1-epsilon-[detlaC] (Met1â€“Val90) is capable of mediating the binding of F1 to F0 to form F0F1 that catalyzes ATP-driven H+ pumping although it does not exert an inhibitory effect on ATPase activity

## Discussion

- No typical nucleotide-binding motif has been found in the amino acid sequence of the subunit epsilon, and no typical nucleotide binding domain has been noticed in the three-dimensional structures of the subunit epsilon either as an isolated one or in the F1
