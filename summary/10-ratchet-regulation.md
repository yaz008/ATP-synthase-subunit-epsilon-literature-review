# Conformational changes in subunit epsilon regulate ATPase activity (ratchet mechanism)

## Abstract

- The F1F0 ATP synthase is the smallest motor enzyme known
- Stator is composed of alpha3-beta3-delta-ab2

## Introduction

- The mitochondrial delta subunit is similar to the bacterial epsilon subunit

## Results

- Figure 1 is a great demonstration of the 2 confotmations
- The first paragraph has almost perfect description of the experiment
- Thus, in one mutant, gA117Cyc-c9Q42C, there is activation whereas in the other, epsilon-L99Cy-S118C, there is strong inhibition of ATP hydrolysis as a result of fixing the different conformations of the subunit epsilon
- DCCD is known to irreversibly block both ATP hydrolysis and synthesis
- Both mutants showed full sensitivity to DCCD indicating that coupling between F1 and F0 was not disrupted by the covalent linking of subunits in either arrangement

## Discussions

- t the electrostatic interaction between the C-terminal helix of the subunit epsilon and the DELSEED motif in the b subunit is essential for the inhibitory effect of the epsilon subunit
- In the reverse (counterclockwise direction), concerted release of the subunit epsilon with a rotation step, if electrostatically and/or sterically blocked, inhibits ATP hydrolysis: such a mechanism would mean that **it works as a ratchet**
- Nucleotide-dependent switching of the location of the C-terminal part of epsilon relative to alpha and beta subunits has been seen (29), which may involve transfer of epsilon from beta to alpha to ready the enzyme for the next 120Â° jump as an ATP is synthesized **_(QUESTIONABLE)_**
- Ratchet function is primitive in the bacterial enzyme and more elaborated in the mitochondrial enzyme by separation of the structural and inhibitory roles of the epsilon in two polypeptides, the d and IF1, respectively
