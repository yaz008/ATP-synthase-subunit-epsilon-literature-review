# Role of the epsilon sybunit as an ATP sensor

## Abstract

- The precise nature of the regulatory role of ATP binding to the subunit epsilon remains to be determined
- weaker binding of ATP correlated with greater inhibition of ATPase activity _(with one exception)_
- ATP binding stabilizes subunit epsilon in contracted conformation

## Introduction

- A great, simple description of the subunit epsilon structure in the second paragraph
- subunit epsilon is both a regulator and sensor of cellular ATP concentration (20-23)
- The results clearly show that ATP binding to the subunit affects the regulation of ATPase activity

## Experiment (meterials & methods is completely useless)

- Fluorescently labeled subunit epsilon was incubated in the assay mixture, and the changes in fluorescence were measured upon addition of ATP
- Fluorescent change was corrected for corresponding measurement without ATP and plotted against ATP concentration

## Results

- Two mutants (R102A and R115A) showed essentially the same profile as the wild type. Four (E83A, R92A, R122A, and R126A) showed no ATP binding, and the other five (R84A, D89A, K94A, E98A, and R99A) showed a moderate degree of binding
- All these (E83A, R92A, R122A, and R126A) residues are conserved between TF1 and BF1.
- Although the crystal structure suggests that the Glu83 and Arg92 residues are important for ATP binding, the mutation at Arg126 was shown to have a more significant effect
- Figure 5 is the overall result of the work
- ATP binding to the subunit may induce conformational changes in the beta subunit, resulting in expulsion of the subunit epsilon from the main cylinder. Once the C-terminal helices are expelled from the main cylinder, ATP can access the binding site on the subunit epsilon
- Fluctuation of the subunit epsilon between folded and extended forms rarely occurs in the absence of ATP binding to the beta subunits - the likely role of ATP binding to the subunit epsilon is to stabilize the epsilon subunit of activated complex in the folded state
- Figure 8 shows a simple diagram of the ATP binding to epsilon and beta sununits
