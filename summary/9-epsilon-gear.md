# Subunit epsilon as a switch to synthesis mode

## Abstract

- The causes of the transition are investigated
- The whole introduction could just be stealed along with the references
- A new conformation of epsilon was found in the crystal structure of the complex of truncated-gamma and epsilon of E. coli F1
- The conformation and arrangement of the up-state epsilon in intact F0F1 is yet unclear

## Study

- It is natural to expect that proton motive force would facilitate the down-to-up transition of the subunit epsilon
- It is clear that the subunit epsilon in F1 and F0F1 adopts reversibly the up-state conformation in the presence of ADP and the down-state conformation in the presence of ATP
- TNP-ADP binding to F1 was not affected by the conformational states of the subunit epsilon
- when proton motive force is provided, the subunit epsilon in F0F1 strongly favors the up-state conformation irrespective of ADP/ATP balance

## Discussions

- A simple picture of the epsilon conformations
- Transition between two forms is determined by proton motive force and ADP/ATP balance
